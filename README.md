# Game-Guess-the-word

Guess the word:
Uses the principles of hangman but displays sections of an ambulance upon wrong guess of the word 

Animates a flashing blue light upon running out on number of guesses

In the screenshots, I use VScode to run the program, but can also be ran via the terminal which requires python to be installed on your local machine. 

Python module download page:  https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to import the following packages: 

Turtle graphics using numpy: pip install numpy-turtle 

May require threading extension: pip install threading2  (but most probably not necessary as threading module is pre-installed in python)

If modules are out of date, please go to: https://pypi.org/ to install relevant packages to run the code.
